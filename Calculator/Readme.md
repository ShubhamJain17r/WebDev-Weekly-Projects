# Calculator
### Author : Shubham Jain
This calculator is referenced from Casio fx-100MS scientific calculator. I tried to replicate its look. In this version the calculator just does simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In later versions; in upcoming weeks; i would improve it for more functionality.

<b>I changed the color theme of the calculator. Might change later ;)</b>

#### Daily Progress
* Day 1 : Designing the calculator on figma;
* Day 2 : Completed the designing of the calculator on html and css files.
* Day 3 : Completed the Calculator Version 1. Used ChatGPT for helping in writing and improving JS code. Replaced Div for equation and Answer with Input. Added value for button.

> Version 1:
>> This calculator does simple addition, multiplication, subtraction and division.Although at start of this project, i decide to add `x10^` button too. In next version i will definitely add this. I added a feature to place cursor and add or remove element from that selected area. I mainly used ChatGPT for this part. 

>> I kept the equation and answer part seperate as it looks easier to interpret. The equation is a text area with `resize` set to `none`. 

>> I used `eval` to evaluate the mathematical expression, although it is not recommended, i just restricted it to certain input only.

This was my first Web Development project. I'm very happy to complete it with minimal help of LLM's. Very excited for my WebDev Journey... :)
