# Calculator
### Author : Shubham Jain
This calculator is referenced from Casio fx-100MS scientific calculator. I tried to replcate its look. In this version the calculator just does simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. I included `x10^` button for powers of 10. In later versions; in upcoming weeks; i would improve it for more functionality.
