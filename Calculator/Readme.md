# Calculator
### Author : Shubham Jain
This calculator is referenced from Casio fx-100MS scientific calculator. I tried to replicate its look. In this version the calculator just does simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. I included `x10^` button for powers of 10. In later versions; in upcoming weeks; i would improve it for more functionality.

<b>I changed the color theme of the calculator. Might change later ;)</b>

#### Daily Progress
* Day 1 : Designing the calculator on figma;
* Day 2 : Completed the designing of the calculator on html and css files.
